The Web3 CitizenAlpha contract is a Web3 of Trust experiment.

## üó∫Ô∏è Overview:

CitizenAlpha (Beta) is an experiment for bootstrapping a Decentralized Society. Combining on-chain permissions and off-chain data (ENS text fields i.e. DIDs, pointers, etc...)

CitizenAlpha is an attempt to better understand Web3 of Trust mechanics. Simple in nature, the contract is only responsible for issuing/revoking of soulbounds. Metadata is generated via an external contract: allowing on-going updates during the Beta.
